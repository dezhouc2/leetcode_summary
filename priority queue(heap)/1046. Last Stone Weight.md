总结:
思路是对的 但是有一个bug就是 while len(heap) >2 应该是 >1才对 因为大于2说明至少3个

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        
        heap = []
        for i in range(len(stones)):
            heapq.heappush(heap,-stones[i])
        
        while len(heap) > 1:
            first = -heapq.heappop(heap)
            second = -heapq.heappop(heap)

            if first == second:
                continue
            
            elif first > second:
                three = first - second
                heapq.heappush(heap, -three)
        
        if not heap:
            return 0
        else:
            return -heap[0]
