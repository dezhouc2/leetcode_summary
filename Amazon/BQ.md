--*: STAR method
situation: set the scene the give details of the example(在什么情况下)

task: describe what your responsibility was in that situation(任务/责任是什么)

action: explain what steps you took to address it(用了什么行动方式)

result: what outcomes your action achieve(达到了什么结果, 从这个结果中学到了什么)


--*: 高频bq问题
1 introduce yourself
    I’ve been working on software design and development related work for over 4 years. My experience includes refining and documenting UI requirements, implementing high-level requirements and producing robust solutions within predefined timelines and scope limitations. I'm so passionate about creating great services for customers and I have been enjoying working with customers. I am always happy to learn new  technologies and incorporate them with what I’ve been doing. Keeping learning and being curious always refreshes my mind with better designs and solutions. Once I commit a task, I will work relentlessly to achieve my goals and will alway try to finish it earlier than what I have promised.

note: mention customer obsession,learn and be curious, deliver result

2. Tell me a time when you disagree with your manager/teammate
Let me share with you a quick story. ..........介绍背景，说出分歧。然后说自己怎么做，可以是讨论trade off, 可以是坚持高标准..等 结局一定说最后的选择是对的。 It proved to work well.

When I worked as an intern at TigerGraph, one of my tasks is to build a graph convolution network to classify classification of nodes in the graph structures. However, my teammate thinks that we should implement graph attentional network. In order to insist the highest standard of our products, I dive up for these two models and figure it out GCN is better. I disconfirm the viewpoint of my teammates. At the end, my model proves to work well and better performances than that of my teammate's

note: disagreee and commit, high standards

3. Tell me a time when you received a negative feedback.
先介绍背景,别人对你哪里不满意了，简单说以下就行，不要说很多别人如何对你不满，也不要sug·ar·coat 说自己其实没错。重点放在自己怎么解决这个问题，以及学到了什么。结果一定是好结果
When I was a graduate student, I worked on a team project regarding a website application. My role in this team project is to implement MySQL as the database for this project. I write some very long query statement that has high time complexity(needs a long time to execute and extract the data). The TA for this course provide me a negative feedback regarding some long query statements that I used. I started to dive deep and to try different approaches to sovle time complexity problem. I do some researches and learn some new grammars in SQL that I do not used and learn before. At the end of this project, I improve 20% of time complexity for long SQL to extract the data for this project.

note: dive deep, different thoughts, learn

4. Tell me a time when you came up with a simple solution to solve a problem
这个问题一定要让面试官信服你说的例子。先说一般的方法很耗时，自己找到一个方法很快就完成并且Deliver 了，而且很稳定，没出过问题，结果要是好的。
When I worked as a machine learning engineer intern at TigerGraph, one of my tasks is to optimize the loading speed for a large amount of graph datasets which over 100 millions of data. The general way of load that amount of graph datasets is time-consuming and sometimes the CPU will trash and I have to do it all over again. I start to dive deep and try out different approaches and to seek a brand new method that can decrease the loading speed. I figure it out a new method that our team never try before called batch. This method allow a whole dataset to split into several equivalent pieces and to load each of the pieces in order. At the end, we develier the new products using this new technique and we try out thousands of cases before delivered. Eventually, it proves to work better than the general method and more stable.

note: dive deep, different thoughts, new insight


5. Tell me your most challenging project/ a time you solved a complex problem
扣题，怎么复杂，是deadline 紧，还是技术复杂，你怎么做的，学习了新技术，use my priavte time to work on it 等等 最后说结果或者说通过这个process 你学到了什么



6. Tell me a time when you missed deadline
先介绍背景 解释为何会miss 你是怎么把损失降到最低的，最后结果是好的，影响不是很大

7. Biggest mistake or failure

8. Tell me a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility

9. Tell me a time when you take caculated rist

10.Tell me a time when you did something without asking approval from you managerg‍‍‍‌‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‌‌‌‍‍‍‍‍

--*:面试coding中可能会用到的:
1.1 如果你可能会沉默一会，要告诉面试官：
“Hi, if I am silent for a couple secs/mins, I am just thinking through the question.”

1.2 如果面试官问你这道题是不是做过
“I do not have the chance to solve exactly question before, but this question is a very typical DFS/BFS/Graph等等 problem. I do prepare because I take this opportunity seriously. I don’t want to waste the opportunity and I don’t waste your time.”
1.3 如果面试官问到某个你不会的skill/framework/language
I do not have a chance to go deep about it but I am very interested in growing my skills in this area. I am a fast learner and making the transition won`t be a challenge.

1.4 Coding中可用句子
Ok. Perfect. Thank you very much!
Is that a good understanding of it? I am more comfortable with Java. So I will start my method signature with Java.
So now I have my method signature, I will run a couple of simple examples to illustrate my thoughts.
What are input/output types? Could I name the variables like....?? Further question: .....(ensure the inputs are valid, form well)
I think I could break down my pseudo code into this...Does this look like an ok approach?
4. Question to Ask Interviwers (Google上很多例子，可以自己选择）
What is your favorite part working here?
What is your favorite Amazon leadership principle and why?
What is the team culture like?
What do you think are the most important qualities for someone to be really successful in this position?
What are the common career paths in this department?
